00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
to power um it also goes both ways so
 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.909 align:start position:0%
to power um it also goes both ways so
when<00:07:48.879><c> you</c><00:07:49.360><c> when</c><00:07:49.520><c> you</c><00:07:50.000><c> uh</c><00:07:50.120><c> feel</c><00:07:50.520><c> powerful</c>

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
when you when you uh feel powerful
 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.869 align:start position:0%
when you when you uh feel powerful
you're<00:07:51.080><c> more</c><00:07:51.280><c> likely</c><00:07:51.560><c> to</c><00:07:51.720><c> do</c><00:07:52.000><c> this</c><00:07:52.520><c> but</c><00:07:52.680><c> it's</c>

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
you're more likely to do this but it's
 

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:56.830 align:start position:0%
you're more likely to do this but it's
also<00:07:53.319><c> possible</c><00:07:54.319><c> that</c><00:07:54.759><c> um</c><00:07:55.280><c> when</c><00:07:55.479><c> you</c><00:07:55.919><c> when</c><00:07:56.080><c> you</c>

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
also possible that um when you when you
 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.790 align:start position:0%
also possible that um when you when you
uh<00:07:57.120><c> pretend</c><00:07:57.520><c> to</c><00:07:57.639><c> be</c><00:07:57.879><c> powerful</c><00:07:58.759><c> you</c><00:07:59.000><c> are</c><00:07:59.560><c> more</c>

00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh pretend to be powerful you are more
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
uh pretend to be powerful you are more

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
second question really was you know so
 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.350 align:start position:0%
second question really was you know so
we<00:08:06.120><c> know</c><00:08:06.319><c> that</c><00:08:06.479><c> our</c><00:08:06.680><c> minds</c><00:08:07.000><c> change</c><00:08:07.319><c> our</c><00:08:07.599><c> bodies</c>

so I'm talking about thoughts and
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
so I'm talking about thoughts and

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:26.469 align:start position:0%
feelings and in my case that's hormones
I<00:08:24.280><c> look</c><00:08:24.440><c> at</c><00:08:24.599><c> hormones</c><00:08:25.440><c> so</c><00:08:25.639><c> what</c><00:08:25.800><c> do</c><00:08:26.000><c> the</c><00:08:26.159><c> minds</c>

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
I look at hormones so what do the minds
 

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:28.749 align:start position:0%
I look at hormones so what do the minds
of<00:08:26.639><c> the</c><00:08:26.840><c> powerful</c><00:08:27.720><c> versus</c><00:08:28.120><c> the</c><00:08:28.280><c> powerless</c>

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
of the powerful versus the powerless
 

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.110 align:start position:0%
of the powerful versus the powerless
look<00:08:29.000><c> like</c>

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
look like
 

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.389 align:start position:0%
look like
so<00:08:30.479><c> powerful</c><00:08:31.279><c> people</c><00:08:32.279><c> tend</c><00:08:32.560><c> to</c><00:08:32.760><c> be</c><00:08:33.200><c> not</c>

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
so powerful people tend to be not
 

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:35.589 align:start position:0%
so powerful people tend to be not
surprisingly<00:08:34.000><c> more</c><00:08:34.200><c> assertive</c><00:08:35.120><c> and</c><00:08:35.279><c> more</c>

surprisingly more assertive and more
 

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.389 align:start position:0%
surprisingly more assertive and more

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
confident uh more more optimistic they
 

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.630 align:start position:0%
confident uh more more optimistic they
actually<00:08:38.640><c> feel</c><00:08:38.919><c> that</c><00:08:39.039><c> they're</c><00:08:39.200><c> going</c><00:08:39.279><c> to</c><00:08:39.399><c> win</c>

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
actually feel that they're going to win
 

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.230 align:start position:0%
actually feel that they're going to win
even<00:08:39.839><c> at</c><00:08:40.000><c> games</c><00:08:40.200><c> of</c><00:08:40.640><c> chance</c><00:08:41.640><c> uh</c><00:08:42.399><c> they</c><00:08:42.640><c> also</c>

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
even at games of chance uh they also
 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.190 align:start position:0%
even at games of chance uh they also
tend<00:08:43.479><c> to</c><00:08:43.599><c> be</c><00:08:43.719><c> able</c><00:08:43.880><c> to</c><00:08:44.039><c> think</c><00:08:44.279><c> more</c><00:08:44.560><c> abstractly</c>

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
tend to be able to think more abstractly
 

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
tend to be able to think more abstractly
so<00:08:45.399><c> there</c><00:08:45.480><c> are</c><00:08:45.560><c> a</c><00:08:45.680><c> lot</c><00:08:45.839><c> of</c><00:08:46.040><c> differences</c><00:08:46.959><c> they</c>

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of differences they
 

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.389 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of differences they
take<00:08:47.279><c> more</c><00:08:47.519><c> risks</c><00:08:47.880><c> there</c><00:08:48.000><c> are</c><00:08:48.080><c> a</c><00:08:48.160><c> lot</c><00:08:48.279><c> of</c>

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
take more risks there are a lot of
 

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.670 align:start position:0%
take more risks there are a lot of

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.949 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
also are differences on two key hormones

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
is the stress hormone so what we find is
 

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:08.230 align:start position:0%
is the stress hormone so what we find is
that<00:09:04.839><c> um</c><00:09:05.839><c> uh</c><00:09:06.160><c> high</c><00:09:06.720><c> power</c><00:09:07.399><c> alpha</c><00:09:07.760><c> males</c><00:09:08.040><c> in</c>
